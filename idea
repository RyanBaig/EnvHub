API ENDPOINT:
(https://api.vercel.com/v10/projects/envhub/env)
await fetch("https://api.vercel.com/v10/projects/prj_XLKmu1DyR1eY7zq8UgeRKbA7yVLA/env", {
  "body": {
    "key": "API_URL",
    "value": "https://api.vercel.com",
    "type": "plain",
    "target": [
      "production",
      "preview"
    ]
  },
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <TOKEN>"
  },
  "method": "post"
})

This is my current idea for the project:
there is a home page for intro
there is a settings page where u set the vars
the vars with the values are sent to the vercel API to set them as environment variables for the website.
then the user is given an api endpoint (prob like /api/vars/(the var name they inserted))
the user can also see the vars he created and can also rename/delete them

Your project idea sounds well-structured and user-focused. Here are some additional considerations and suggestions:

User-Friendly Interface:

Ensure that both the home page and settings page have a user-friendly and intuitive design. Use clear and concise language to guide users through the process.
Interactive Settings Page:

Make the settings page interactive, allowing users to easily add, edit, and delete environment variables. Consider using form validation to prevent errors.
API Endpoint Visibility:

Clearly display the generated API endpoint for each variable. Consider providing a copy-to-clipboard feature for convenience.
Variable Management:

Implement a page where users can view, rename, and delete their existing variables. This adds flexibility and control for users managing their environment.
Security Measures:

Since you're dealing with sensitive information like environment variables, prioritize security. Use HTTPS, encrypt data in transit, and implement secure coding practices.
Documentation:

Provide clear documentation or tooltips to guide users on how to use the service effectively. This can include explanations of API endpoints, variable naming conventions, etc.
Feedback Mechanism:

Implement feedback mechanisms, such as success messages or error notifications, to keep users informed about the status of their actions.
User Account Management (Optional):

If applicable, consider adding user accounts to allow users to save and manage their environment variables across sessions.
